# Goal

Your goal is to cleanse the country of Wisches of corruption.
To do this, you have two magic wands:

- The first allows you to cast devastating fire spells to kill your opponents or cast healing magic to purify your target.
- The second allows you to use a magic grapple that allows you to move faster on the map and safely escape from corrupted enemies.
Be careful, however, your magic is not infinite and it would be a shame to fall in the middle of hostile creatures.

Try to kill or heal as many enemies as possible and perform the most exploits to get the highest score!
